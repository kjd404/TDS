# Codex Agent Instructions

This project uses the Gradle build system but does not contain unit tests. If you need to build the project, run:

```
gradle build
```

The `gradlew` wrapper script is outdated and not executable, so rely on the system `gradle`.

No automated tests exist, so the build step may fail on older Gradle scripts. If it does, note the failure and proceed.
